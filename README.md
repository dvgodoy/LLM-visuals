This repository was inspired by the [ML Visuals](https://github.com/dair-ai/ml-visuals) repository maintained by [dair.ai](https://dair.ai/).

**LLM Visuals** contains **62 unique images** divided in **5 categories**. All the images were originally published in my book ["A Hands-On Guide to Fine-Tuning LLMs with PyTorch and Hugging Face"](https://pytorchstepbystep.com/llms).

## Can I Freely Use These Images?

Sure, these images can be FREELY USED in your own blog posts, slides, presentations, or papers under the CC-BY license.
